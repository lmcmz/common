## Getting Started
For Getting Started with React Native there is a very comprehensive guide on their website

https://reactnative.dev/docs/getting-started

There are two documentation options: Expo CLI Quickstart & React Native CLI Quickstart.

Choose the React Native CLI Quickstart and then choose whether you use a Mac, Linux or Windows

### Files containing keys

You will need three files
 1. For React Native - `env.json`
 2. For iOS `GoogleService-Info.plist`
 3. For Android `google-services.json`

You can ge these files from one of the members of the developer team to get started.

The `env.json` is to be placed into the root folder of the React Native project.

The `GoogleService-Info.plist` is to be placed in the `common/Support` folder

The `google-services.json` file is to be placed in the `*to be filled*`

### Getting Started from the Common Github Repo

1. Clone the repo `git clone https://github.com/daostack/common.git`
2. `cd common` and run `yarn` or `npm install`
3. `cd ios` and run `pod install`

** After running `pod install` you will receive an error while running the app.

** 'Firebase.h' file not found with <angled> use "quotes" instead.

** You will need to replace the angled brackets from `#import <Firebase.h>` with `#import "Firebase.h"` in the `/RNFirebaseFirestore.h` and `/RNFirebaseUtil.h` files

### For iOS

4. To run the project from the command line run `react-native run-ios`
5. To run from Xcode, open the `common.xcworkspace` file and then enter `command + r`

### For Android

6. Run an Android simulator device
7. Enter `react-native run-android` in the command line

If the project doesn't run there may be a few reasons.

The most common is:

Replace the sdk.dir path to match your environment of the file `android/local.properties`

in Windows `sdk.dir = C:\\Users\\USERNAME\\AppData\\Local\\Android\\sdk`

in macOS `sdk.dir = /Users/USERNAME/Library/Android/sdk`

in linux `sdk.dir = /home/USERNAME/Android/Sdk`

Or this error `package android.support.annotation does not exist`

Please enter command `npx jetify` in terminal. [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/53235525/issues-using-androidx-and-react-native)
